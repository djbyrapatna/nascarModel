# Structure:
# 1. Establish Y data set
#     a. Start with Brickyard 400 results
#     b. Then move back to last 3,4,5, etc (will require change in how I process data)
# 2. Establish X data set
#     a. Prev race results
#     b. Curr race practice and qual results
#     c. All race, practice, qual results
#     d. Loop data only
#     e. Loop and race
#     f. All combined
# After trying with b, figure out how I'd like to proceed
